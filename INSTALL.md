# Power Dolphin Installation Guide

Thank you for purchasing **Power Dolphinüê¨**!  
This mod allows you to power your Nintendo GameCube using modern USB-C chargers that support **PD (Power Delivery)** or **QC (Quick Charge)** at 12 V.  
This guide will walk you through testing and installing Power Dolphin on your GameCube.

---

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- A **Gamebit screwdriver** to open the GameCube shell  
- A **USB-C charger** that supports PD or QC at **12 V / 3 A**  
  (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for compatibility details)  
- A **small Phillips screwdriver (PH0)** to secure the Power Dolphin power board  
- *(Optional)* **Fine-tip tweezers**, which can make some steps easier  

---

## Test Your USB-C Charger with Power Dolphin

Before opening your GameCube, verify that your charger is compatible:

1. Plug the charger into the wall.  
2. Connect a USB-C cable from the charger to the Power Dolphin board.  

A **green LED** should light up within a few seconds.  
This means your charger successfully negotiated **12 V output**, which is what the GameCube requires.

If the LED **doesn‚Äôt light up**:
- Check the specifications printed on your charger ‚Äî it may not support 12 V output.  
- Some cheap USB-C cables lack the **data wires** required for Power Dolphin to negotiate PD/QC, and therefore won‚Äôt work.

More compatibility details can be found in the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Installation

If your charger passes the test, you can proceed to install Power Dolphin.

1. Use the Gamebit screwdriver to remove the **four long screws** from the bottom corners of the GameCube.  
   ![20251018_214945.jpg](images/20251018_214945.jpg)

2. Carefully flip the console over and lift off the **top shell**.  
   ![20251018_215026.jpg](images/20251018_215026.jpg)

3. Tilt and pull the **black back cover** outward.  
   ![20251018_215053.jpg](images/20251018_215053.jpg)

4. Turn the GameCube so the **back side** faces you.  
   ![20251018_215115.jpg](images/20251018_215115.jpg)

5. Gently unplug the two connectors:  
   - The **thicker** one is for power.  
   - The **thinner** one is for the fan.

   ![20251018_215200.jpg](images/20251018_215200.jpg)

6. Use the PH0 screwdriver to remove the **black screw** in the center of the power board.  
   ![20251018_215215.jpg](images/20251018_215215.jpg)

7. Lift out the **original power board**.  
   ![20251018_215233.jpg](images/20251018_215233.jpg)

8. Place the **Power Dolphin board** in the same position.  
   ![20251018_215245.jpg](images/20251018_215245.jpg)

9. Reinstall the **black screw** to secure the board.  
   ![20251018_215308.jpg](images/20251018_215308.jpg)

10. Reconnect both the **power** and **fan** connectors to Power Dolphin.  
    - The board includes a **third connector** (center) for **PC-standard fans** (Molex KK 2.54 mm).  
    - If you‚Äôre using a fan mod such as a **Noctua 4010**, you can plug it directly into this middle connector.  
    ![20251018_215357.jpg](images/20251018_215357.jpg)

11. Push the **back cover** gently into place. This completes the lower half of the installation.  
    ![20251018_215434.jpg](images/20251018_215434.jpg)

12. Next, replace the **original power button** with the **Power Dolphin button**:  
    - From the inside of the top shell, gently push the button out using tweezers, a screwdriver, or your fingers.  
      ![20251018_220007.jpg](images/20251018_220007.jpg)
      ![20251018_220023.jpg](images/20251018_220023.jpg)
    - From the top side, align and push in the new Power Dolphin button.

13. Before reattaching the top shell, make sure:
    1. The **power wires** are tucked into their groove.  
       ![20251018_215904.jpg](images/20251018_215904.jpg)
    2. The **fan wires** are also properly routed in their groove.  
       ![20251018_215411.jpg](images/20251018_215411.jpg)

14. Reinstall the top shell. Ensure that all **four corners** sit evenly on the bottom shell.

## Troubleshooting

If the **green LED** on the Power Dolphin doesn‚Äôt light up, it means the board couldn‚Äôt negotiate a **12 V output** from your USB-C PD/QC charger.  

Many chargers don‚Äôt clearly state which voltages and currents each port supports ‚Äî even reputable brands like **Belkin**, **Anker**, or **Ugreen**.  
Always check the **label on the charger**, which usually lists exact specifications, such as:

![20251018_220903.jpg](images/20251018_220903.jpg)

Even with a proper charger, not all **ports** provide the same power.  
In the example above:
- **USB-C1** and **USB-C2** output **12 V / 3 A** ‚úÖ  
- **USB-C3** outputs **12 V / 2.5 A** (minimum, not recommended) ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- **USB-A** outputs **12 V / 1.5 A** (insufficient ‚Äî may fail to power on or read discs) ‚ùå  

Therefore, for this charger, only **USB-C1** and **USB-C2** should be used with the GameCube.

**In short, use a charger and port that provide:**  
- **Voltage:** exactly **12 V**  
- **Current:** at least **2.5 A** (3 A or higher recommended)

### Cable Compatibility

Some cheap USB-C cables only include **two or four wires** (so-called ‚Äúcharging-only‚Äù cables).  
These cables can only deliver **5 V** and lack the data lines required for PD/QC negotiation.  
Avoid using them.

### USB-C Port Cover

If the **3D-printed USB-C port cover** came loose during shipping, simply press it back in place as shown below:
